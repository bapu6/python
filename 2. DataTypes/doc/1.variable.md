# Python Variables, Data Types, and Reference Information

This guide demonstrates how to define variables of various data types in Python, check their types, memory addresses, reference counts, and understand variable declaration rules.

## 1. Variable Declaration Rules in Python

- **Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).**
- **Variable names must start with a letter or underscore (_), not a number.**
- **Variable names are case-sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are different).**
- **Avoid using Python reserved keywords as variable names (e.g., `class`, `for`, `if`).**
- **Variable names should be descriptive and readable.**

**Examples:**

```python
my_var = 10      # Valid
_myVar = 20      # Valid
myVar2 = 30      # Valid
# 2myVar = 40    # Invalid: cannot start with a number
# class = 50     # Invalid: 'class' is a reserved keyword
```

## 2. Data Types in Python

Python supports several built-in data types. Here are some examples:

```python
data_types = {
    "int": 42,
    "float": 3.14,
    "str": "Hello, World!",
    "bool": True,
    "list": [1, 2, 3],
    "tuple": (1, 2, 3),
    "set": {1, 2, 3},
    "dict": {"name": "Bapu", "age": 25},
    "complex": complex(1, 2),
    "bytes": bytes(5),
    "bytearray": bytearray(5),
    "frozenset": frozenset([1, 2, 3]),
}
# Printing the data types and their values
for data_type, value in data_types.items():
    print(f"{data_type}: {value} (type: {type(value)})")
```

## 3. Valid and Invalid Variable Names

```python
# Valid variable names:
myVar = 5
my_variable = 15
myVar3 = 25
_myVar = 20
my_var = 10
myVar2 = 30

# Invalid variable names:
# 1myVar = 35    # Invalid: cannot start with a number
# class = 45     # Invalid: 'class' is a reserved keyword
# my-var = 55    # Invalid: cannot contain hyphens
```

## 4. Variable Details: Value, Type, and Memory Address

When you declare a variable, Python stores:
1. **Reference count** (how many references point to this variable)
2. **Value** of the variable
3. **Type** of the variable

Example:

```python
s = 10  # this stores 3 information in the variable s in memory

print("type of s: ", type(s)) # this will print the type of the variable s
print("id of s: ", id(s))     # this will print the memory address of the variable s
print("value of s: ", s)      # this will print the value of the variable s

# Now let's declare a new variable t with the same value as s
t = 10
print("type of t: ", type(t))
print("id of t: ", id(t))     # this will print the memory address of the variable t which is same as s
print("value of t: ", t)
```

## 5. How to Find Reserved Keywords in Python

You can view the list of reserved keywords in Python using the built-in `help` method:

```python
help("keywords")  # this will print the list of reserved keywords in python
```
