# Python Comments: Interactive Guide

Welcome! This guide demonstrates **comments** in Python. You can run the code snippets directly in an online compiler like [replit](https://replit.com/languages/python3) or [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit).

---

## 1. Single-line Comment

```python
# This is a single-line comment in Python

print("Hello, World!")  # this is an inline comment
```
▶️ **Try running this code!**  
What do you see in the output?  
*Hint: Comments are ignored by Python.*

---

## 2. Multi-line Comment

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment in Python.
It can span multiple lines.
You can use it to explain complex logic or provide detailed documentation.
"""
print("Multi-line comment above!")
```
▶️ **Run this code.**  
Does the multi-line comment affect the output?

---

## 3. Docstrings

```python
def example_function():
    """
    This function does nothing but serves as an example.
    It has a docstring that explains its purpose.
    """
    pass  # This is a single-line comment inside a function

help(example_function)
```
▶️ **Run this code.**  
What does `help(example_function)` show?

---

## 4. Disabling Code with Comments

```python
# print("This line is commented out and won't execute.")
print("Only this line will print!")
```
▶️ **Try uncommenting the first line.**  
What changes in the output?

## 5. Commenting Best Practices

- Use comments to explain complex logic.
- Keep comments up to date with code changes.
- Avoid over-commenting; code should be self-explanatory when possible.
- Use comments to highlight important sections or decisions.
- Leave notes for yourself or other developers:
  - `# TODO: Implement error handling`
  - `# FIXME: This function needs optimization`
  - `# NOTE: This is a temporary solution`
