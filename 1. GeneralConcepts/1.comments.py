# Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter
# They are useful for documentation and explaining code logic.
# Remember to use comments wisely to make your code more readable and maintainable.
# Comments can also be used to leave notes for yourself or other developers
# For example: # TODO: Implement error handling
# Always keep your comments up to date with your code changes
# Use comments to clarify complex code sections
# Avoid over-commenting; code should be self-explanatory when possible
# Use comments to highlight important sections or decisions in your code
# Comments can also be used to provide context for future changes
# For example: # FIXME: This function needs optimization
# Use comments to explain why certain decisions were made
# Comments can also be used to provide context for future changes
# For example: # NOTE: This is a temporary solution until we find a better approach
# Use comments to explain the purpose of a block of code
